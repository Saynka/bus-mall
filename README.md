This is a pp designed for people to use to display and kinda of sort threw new products you can have customers vote on things that they would buy or like. and based on their input eather get rid of things or push the things they like more.

there is html working with css and javaskript, there is a little bit of local stoarage for the users for conveinece people should enjoy the aesthetic of the lay out.
